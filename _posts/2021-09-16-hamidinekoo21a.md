title: "Automated Quantification Of Blood Microvessels In\r Hematoxylin And Eosin
  Whole Slide Images"
abstract: "Tumour cells require resources to survive and\r proliferate. In order to
  be provided with a\r supportive micro-environment rich with resources to\r sustain
  optimal growth, tumour cells tend to reside\r in close proximity to a network of
  blood\r vessels. Quantification of blood microvessel density\r can be a useful measure
  to investigate the\r importance of resource limitation in tumours for\r prognostication
  and assigning treatment and mode of\r drug delivery. Currently, immunohistochemistry
  (IHC)\r with specific antibodies and the subsequent\r detection of its binding in
  the tumour tissue are\r used to identify microvessels. The automated\r quantification
  of blood microvessels in Hematoxylin\r and Eosin (H&E) stained images is not widely\r
  studied because microvessels are very complex and\r heterogeneous.  In addition,
  their manual\r identification is tedious, time-consuming and\r subjective.  We investigate
  whether the vasculature\r in H&E can be robustly identified in whole slide\r sections
  that would ultimately avoid the need for\r IHC and manual annotations.  We propose
  an\r artificial intelligence model based on Generative\r Adversarial Networks (GAN)
  that, from an input H&E\r image, can generate a synthetic Erythroblast\r Transformation
  specific related gene (ERG) stained\r image, highlighting vessel structures. We
  also\r trained a spatially constrained Convolutional Neural\r Network (CNN) to identify
  single cells on ERG\r stained whole slide images, and found good\r concordance between
  detected cells in synthetic and\r real ERG. This pipeline was evaluated on 2002
  image\r patches of size 2000x2000 pixels, sampled from 9\r whole slide images.  We
  achieved the mean $R^2$ of\r 0.70$\\pm$0.14 in our testing set.  This pipeline can\r
  pave the way to study proximity of tumour cells to\r blood vessels.  This approach
  has the potential to\r reduce the use of IHC and tissues and enable large\r quantitative
  studies."
