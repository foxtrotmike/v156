title: "SMILE: Sparse-Attention based Multiple Instance\r Contrastive Learning for
  Glioma Sub-Type\r Classification Using Pathological Images"
abstract: "Gliomas are the most prevalent malignant brain tumor\r in adults and can
  be classified into four typical\r sub-types based on histological features.\r Histological
  diagnosis by pathologists via\r microscopic visual inspection of pathological slides\r
  has been the gold standard for glioma grading,\r especially hematoxylin and eosin
  (H&E) sections.\r However, due to spatial heterogeneity and complex\r tumor micro-environment,
  it is difficult and\r time-consuming for pathologists to differentiate\r glioma
  sub-types. In this paper, we propose a\r Sparse-attention based Multiple Instance
  contrastive\r LEarning (SMILE) method for glioma sub-type\r classification.  First,
  we use contrastive learning\r to extract meaningful representations from\r pathological
  images.  Second, we propose the\r sparse-attention multiple instance learning\r
  aggregator to get sparse instance representations in\r a bag for label prediction.
  \ We validate the\r proposed SMILE method using a glioma dataset from\r The Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA).  Experimental\r results show superior performance of our method
  over\r competing ones.  Ablation study further demonstrates\r the effectiveness
  of our design of SMILE."
