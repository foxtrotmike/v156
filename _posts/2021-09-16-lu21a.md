title: 'SMILE: Sparse-Attention based Multiple Instance Contrastive Learning for Glioma
  Sub-Type Classification Using Pathological Images'
abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent malignant brain tumor in adults and can be
  classified into four typical sub-types based on histological features. Histological
  diagnosis by pathologists via microscopic visual inspection of pathological slides
  has been the gold standard for glioma grading, especially hematoxylin and eosin
  (H&E) sections. However, due to spatial heterogeneity and complex tumor micro-environment,
  it is difficult and time-consuming for pathologists to differentiate glioma sub-types.
  In this paper, we propose a Sparse-attention based Multiple Instance contrastive
  LEarning (SMILE) method for glioma sub-type classification.  First, we use contrastive
  learning to extract meaningful representations from pathological images.  Second,
  we propose the sparse-attention multiple instance learning aggregator to get sparse
  instance representations in a bag for label prediction.  We validate the proposed
  SMILE method using a glioma dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  Experimental
  results show superior performance of our method over competing ones.  Ablation study
  further demonstrates the effectiveness of our design of SMILE.
