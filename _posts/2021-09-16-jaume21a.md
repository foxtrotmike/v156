title: 'HistoCartography: A Toolkit for Graph Analytics in Digital Pathology'
abstract: Advances in entity-graph analysis of histopathology images have brought
  in a new paradigm to describe tissue composition, and learn the tissue structure-to-function
  relationship.  Entity-graphs offer flexible and scalable representations to characterize
  tissue organization, while allowing the incorporation of prior pathological knowledge
  to further support model explainability.  However, their analysis requires prerequisites
  for image-to-graph translation and knowledge of state-of-the-art algorithms applied
  to graph-structured data, which can potentially hinder their adoption.  In this
  work, we aim to alleviate these issues by developing HistoCartography, a standardized
  python API with necessary preprocessing, machine learning and explainability tools
  to facilitate graph-analytics in computational pathology. Further, we have benchmarked
  the computational time and performance on multiple datasets across different imaging
  types and histopathology tasks to highlight the applicability of the API for building
  computational pathology workflows. HistoCartography is available at https://github.com/histocartography/histocartography.
