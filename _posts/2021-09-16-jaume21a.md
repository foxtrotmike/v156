title: "HistoCartography: A Toolkit for Graph Analytics in\r Digital Pathology"
abstract: "Advances in entity-graph analysis of histopathology\r images have brought
  in a new paradigm to describe\r tissue composition, and learn the tissue\r structure-to-function
  relationship.  Entity-graphs\r offer flexible and scalable representations to\r
  characterize tissue organization, while allowing the\r incorporation of prior pathological
  knowledge to\r further support model explainability.  However,\r their analysis
  requires prerequisites for\r image-to-graph translation and knowledge of\r state-of-the-art
  algorithms applied to\r graph-structured data, which can potentially hinder\r their
  adoption.  In this work, we aim to alleviate\r these issues by developing HistoCartography,
  a\r standardized python API with necessary\r preprocessing, machine learning and
  explainability\r tools to facilitate graph-analytics in computational\r pathology.
  Further, we have benchmarked the\r computational time and performance on multiple\r
  datasets across different imaging types and\r histopathology tasks to highlight
  the applicability\r of the API for building computational pathology\r workflows.
  HistoCartography is available at\r https://github.com/histocartography/histocartography."
