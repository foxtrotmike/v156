title: "A Novel Cell Map Representation for Weakly\r Supervised Prediction of ER &
  PR Status from H&E\r WSIs"
abstract: "Digital pathology opens new pathways for\r computational algorithms to
  play a significant role\r in the prognosis, diagnosis, and analysis of\r cancer.
  However, handling large whole slide images\r (WSIs) is a vital challenge that these
  algorithms\r encounter. In this paper, we propose a novel\r technique that creates
  a compressed representation\r of histology images. This representation is composed\r
  of cellular maps and compresses the WSIs while\r keeping relevant information at
  hand including the\r spatial relationships between cells. The compression\r technique
  is used to predict the status of ER & PR\r expressions from H&E WSIs. Our results
  show that\r the proposed compression technique can improve the\r prediction performance
  by 11-26%."
