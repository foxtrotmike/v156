title: A Novel Cell Map Representation for Weakly Supervised Prediction of ER & PR
  Status from H&E WSIs
abstract: Digital pathology opens new pathways for computational algorithms to play
  a significant role in the prognosis, diagnosis, and analysis of cancer. However,
  handling large whole slide images (WSIs) is a vital challenge that these algorithms
  encounter. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that creates a compressed
  representation of histology images. This representation is composed of cellular
  maps and compresses the WSIs while keeping relevant information at hand including
  the spatial relationships between cells. The compression technique is used to predict
  the status of ER & PR expressions from H&E WSIs. Our results show that the proposed
  compression technique can improve the prediction performance by 11-26%.
