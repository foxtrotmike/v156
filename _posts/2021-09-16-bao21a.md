title: Random Multi-Channel Image Synthesis for Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Imaging
abstract: 'Multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) is an emerging imaging technique that
  produces the high sensitivity and specificity of single-cell mapping. With a tenet
  of “seeing is believing”, MxIF enables iterative staining and imaging extensive
  antibodies, which provides comprehensive biomarkers to segment and group different
  cells on a single tissue section. However, considerable depletion of the scarce
  tissue is inevitable from extensive rounds of staining and bleaching (“missing tissue”).
  Moreover, the immunofluorescence (IF) imaging can globally fail for particular rounds
  (“missing stain”). In this work, we focus on the “missing stain” issue. It would
  be appealing to develop digital image synthesis approaches to restore missing stain
  images without losing more tissue physically. Herein, we aim to develop image synthesis
  approaches for eleven MxIF structural molecular markers (i.e., epithelial and stromal)
  on real samples. We propose a novel multi-channel high-resolution image synthesis
  approach, called pixN2N-HD, to tackle possible missing stain scenarios via a high-resolution
  generative adversarial network (GAN). Our contribution is three-fold: (1) a single
  deep network framework is proposed to tackle missing stain in MxIF; (2) the proposed
  “N-to-N” strategy reduces theoretical four years of computational time to 20 hours
  when covering all possible missing stains scenarios, with up to five missing stains
  (e.g., “(N-1)-to-1”, “(N-2)-to-2”); and (3) this work is the first comprehensive
  experimental study of investigating cross-stain synthesis in MxIF. Our results elucidate
  a promising direction of advancing MxIF imaging with deep image synthesis. '
