title: "Random Multi-Channel Image Synthesis for Multiplexed\r Immunofluorescence
  Imaging"
abstract: "Multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) is an emerging\r imaging technique
  that produces the high sensitivity\r and specificity of single-cell mapping. With
  a tenet\r of “seeing is believing”, MxIF enables iterative\r staining and imaging
  extensive antibodies, which\r provides comprehensive biomarkers to segment and\r
  group different cells on a single tissue\r section. However, considerable depletion
  of the\r scarce tissue is inevitable from extensive rounds of\r staining and bleaching
  (“missing\r tissue”). Moreover, the immunofluorescence (IF)\r imaging can globally
  fail for particular rounds\r (“missing stain”). In this work, we focus on the\r
  “missing stain” issue. It would be appealing to\r develop digital image synthesis
  approaches to\r restore missing stain images without losing more\r tissue physically.
  Herein, we aim to develop image\r synthesis approaches for eleven MxIF structural\r
  molecular markers (i.e., epithelial and stromal) on\r real samples. We propose a
  novel multi-channel\r high-resolution image synthesis approach, called\r pixN2N-HD,
  to tackle possible missing stain\r scenarios via a high-resolution generative\r
  adversarial network (GAN). Our contribution is\r three-fold: (1) a single deep network
  framework is\r proposed to tackle missing stain in MxIF; (2) the\r proposed “N-to-N”
  strategy reduces theoretical\r four years of computational time to 20 hours when\r
  covering all possible missing stains scenarios, with\r up to five missing stains
  (e.g., “(N-1)-to-1”,\r “(N-2)-to-2”); and (3) this work is the first\r comprehensive
  experimental study of investigating\r cross-stain synthesis in MxIF. Our results
  elucidate\r a promising direction of advancing MxIF imaging with\r deep image synthesis. "
