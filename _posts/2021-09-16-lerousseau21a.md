title: 'SparseConvMIL: Sparse Convolutional Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning
  for Whole Slide Image Classification'
abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the preferred approach for whole slide
  image classification. However, most MIL approaches do not exploit the interdependencies
  of tiles extracted from a whole slide image, which could provide valuable cues for
  classification. This paper presents a novel MIL approach that exploits the spatial
  relationship of tiles for classifying whole slide images. To do so, a sparse map
  is built from tiles embeddings, and is then classified by a sparse-input CNN. It
  obtained state-of-the-art performance over popular MIL approaches on the classification
  of cancer subtype involving 10,000 whole slide images. Our results suggest that
  the proposed approach might (i) improve the representation learning of instances
  and (ii) exploit the context of instance embeddings to enhance the classification
  performance. The code of this work is made open-source.
