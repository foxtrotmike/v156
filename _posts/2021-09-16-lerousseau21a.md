title: "SparseConvMIL: Sparse Convolutional Context-Aware\r Multiple Instance Learning
  for Whole Slide Image\r Classification"
abstract: "Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the preferred\r approach for whole
  slide image\r classification. However, most MIL approaches do not\r exploit the
  interdependencies of tiles extracted\r from a whole slide image, which could provide\r
  valuable cues for classification. This paper\r presents a novel MIL approach that
  exploits the\r spatial relationship of tiles for classifying whole\r slide images.
  To do so, a sparse map is built from\r tiles embeddings, and is then classified
  by a\r sparse-input CNN. It obtained state-of-the-art\r performance over popular
  MIL approaches on the\r classification of cancer subtype involving 10,000\r whole
  slide images. Our results suggest that the\r proposed approach might (i) improve
  the\r representation learning of instances and (ii)\r exploit the context of instance
  embeddings to\r enhance the classification performance. The code of\r this work
  is made open-source."
