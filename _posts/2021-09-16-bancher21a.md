title: Improving Mask R-CNN for Nuclei Instance Segmentation in Hematoxylin & Eosin-Stained
  Histological Images
abstract: 'Digital pathology is an emerging topic in the analysis of pathologic tissue
  samples. It includes providing the tools towards more automated workflows to derive
  clinically relevant information. Digitization and storage of whole slide images
  have become commonplace and allow modern image analysis methods to be used. In recent
  years, computer-based segmentation of cell nuclei has gathered considerable attention
  in the development of highly specialized algorithms. Currently, most of these algorithms
  are based on performing semantic segmentation of all cell nuclei and separating
  overlapping instances in a post-processing step. Recently, instance-aware segmentation
  methods such as Mask R-CNN have been proposed to enable unified instance detection
  and segmentation, even in overlapping cases. In this work, we propose a modified
  Mask R-CNN-based approach by incorporating distance maps of instances and hematoxylin-stain
  intensities as extra input channels to the model. Moreover, we explore the impact
  of three well-known inference strategies, namely test-time augmentation, ensembling,
  and knowledge transfer through pre-training on the segmentation performance. We
  perform extensive ablation experiments across multiple runs to quantitatively define
  the most optimal inference strategy in the proposed Mask R-CNN algorithm. Our results
  show that average instance segmentation improvements of up to 3.5% and 4.1% based
  on Aggregate Jaccard Index and Panoptic Quality score can be obtained, respectively,
  using the proposed techniques in comparison to a standard Mask R-CNN model. Our
  findings confirm the effectiveness of aggregating information at the network input
  stage and optimizing inference workflows using minimal effort. Implemented modifications
  and codes are publicly available through a GitHub repository under: https://github.com/bbanc/Improved-Mask-R-CNN-for-nuclei-segmentation'
