title: "Improving Mask R-CNN for Nuclei Instance\r Segmentation in Hematoxylin & Eosin-Stained\r
  Histological Images"
abstract: "Digital pathology is an emerging topic in the\r analysis of pathologic
  tissue samples. It includes\r providing the tools towards more automated workflows\r
  to derive clinically relevant\r information. Digitization and storage of whole slide\r
  images have become commonplace and allow modern\r image analysis methods to be used.
  In recent years,\r computer-based segmentation of cell nuclei has\r gathered considerable
  attention in the development\r of highly specialized algorithms. Currently, most
  of\r these algorithms are based on performing semantic\r segmentation of all cell
  nuclei and separating\r overlapping instances in a post-processing\r step. Recently,
  instance-aware segmentation methods\r such as Mask R-CNN have been proposed to enable\r
  unified instance detection and segmentation, even in\r overlapping cases. In this
  work, we propose a\r modified Mask R-CNN-based approach by incorporating\r distance
  maps of instances and hematoxylin-stain\r intensities as extra input channels to
  the\r model. Moreover, we explore the impact of three\r well-known inference strategies,
  namely test-time\r augmentation, ensembling, and knowledge transfer\r through pre-training
  on the segmentation\r performance. We perform extensive ablation\r experiments across
  multiple runs to quantitatively\r define the most optimal inference strategy in
  the\r proposed Mask R-CNN algorithm. Our results show that\r average instance segmentation
  improvements of up to\r 3.5% and 4.1% based on Aggregate Jaccard Index and\r Panoptic
  Quality score can be obtained,\r respectively, using the proposed techniques in\r
  comparison to a standard Mask R-CNN model. Our\r findings confirm the effectiveness
  of aggregating\r information at the network input stage and\r optimizing inference
  workflows using minimal\r effort. Implemented modifications and codes are\r publicly
  available through a GitHub repository\r under:\r https://github.com/bbanc/Improved-Mask-R-CNN-for-nuclei-segmentation"
