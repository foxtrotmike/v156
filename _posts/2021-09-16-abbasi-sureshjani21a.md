title: "Molecular Subtype Prediction for Breast Cancer Using\r H&E Specialized Backbone"
abstract: " Identifying the molecular markers to categorize\r breast cancer is one
  of the key steps in determining\r the prognosis and treatment strategy. The standard\r
  clinical practice is to do this analysis based on\r multiple immunohistochemistry
  (IHC) stainings for\r each biomarker, which is expensive and inconsistent\r when
  lacking resources. In this work, we\r investigated the predictiveness of morphological\r
  characteristics of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)\r stained tissues for molecular subtype
  analysis, as\r an initial step for direct treatment response\r prediction based
  on H&E whole slide images\r (WSI). Transfer learning using backbones pre-trained\r
  on natural images is a common practice to deal with\r the challenge of lack of large
  and precisely\r annotated datasets. However, using pre-training on\r natural images
  is not optimal for clinical images.\r To deal with this challenge and leverage large
  pools\r of unlabeled data, we propose to use a specialized\r backbone pre-trained
  on H&E WSI in a\r self-supervised setting, i.e. without any\r labels. Our experiments
  show that this backbone is\r capable of learning discriminating morphological\r
  characteristics from H&E images which are well\r predictive of the molecular subtypes
  in weakly\r supervised settings. Also, the network performs\r better in terms of
  generalization to unseen data\r from new scanner types, despite the relatively small\r
  size of the dataset used for pre-training the\r backbone.  "
