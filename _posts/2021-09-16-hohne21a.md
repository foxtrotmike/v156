title: 'Detecting genetic alterations in BRAF and NTRK as oncogenic drivers in digital
  pathology images: towards model generalization within and across multiple thyroid
  cohorts'
abstract: 'In this paper, we describe the machine learning problem of identifying
  different types of tumors based on digital pathology images. Given a set of Hematoxylin
  and Eosin (H&E) stained images of thyroid tumors, we train deep learning models
  to detect two known molecular oncogenic drivers: \textit{BRAF} mutations and \textit{NTRK}
  gene fusions. We implement an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) classifier
  and we assess its generalization within and across three independent cohorts. We
  find that the model can detect both oncogenic drivers with the MIL approach, however
  the problem remains challenging: our exhaustive evaluation scenarios exemplify unknown
  data drifts and batch effects in digital pathology as the model performance decreases
  when processing images from an unseen cohort. These findings highlight the necessity
  of rich and diverse datasets for training and evaluation as well as methods for
  domain-agnostic learning.'
