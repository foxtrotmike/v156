title: "Multi-Scale Task Multiple Instance Learning for the\r Classification of Digital
  Pathology Images with\r Global Annotations"
abstract: "Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution\r digitized images of tissue
  samples, stored including\r different magnification levels.  WSIs datasets often\r
  include only global annotations, available thanks to\r pathology reports.  Global
  annotations refer to\r global findings in the high-resolution image and do\r not
  include information about the location of the\r regions of interest or the magnification
  levels used\r to identify a finding.  This fact can limit the\r training of machine
  learning models, as WSIs are\r usually very large and each magnification level\r
  includes different information about the tissue.\r This paper presents a Multi-Scale
  Task Multiple\r Instance Learning (MuSTMIL) method, allowing to\r better exploit
  data paired with global labels and to\r combine contextual and detailed information\r
  identified at several magnification levels.  The\r method is based on a multiple
  instance learning\r framework and on a multi-task network, that combines\r features
  from several magnification levels and\r produces multiple predictions (a global
  one and one\r for each magnification level involved).  MuSTMIL is\r evaluated on
  colon cancer images, on binary and\r multilabel classification.  MuSTMIL shows an\r
  improvement in performance in comparison to both\r single scale and another multi-scale
  multiple\r instance learning algorithm, demonstrating that\r MuSTMIL can help to
  better deal with global labels\r targeting full and multi-scale images."
