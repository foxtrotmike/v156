title: Multi-Scale Task Multiple Instance Learning for the Classification of Digital
  Pathology Images with Global Annotations
abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution digitized images of tissue
  samples, stored including different magnification levels.  WSIs datasets often include
  only global annotations, available thanks to pathology reports.  Global annotations
  refer to global findings in the high-resolution image and do not include information
  about the location of the regions of interest or the magnification levels used to
  identify a finding.  This fact can limit the training of machine learning models,
  as WSIs are usually very large and each magnification level includes different information
  about the tissue. This paper presents a Multi-Scale Task Multiple Instance Learning
  (MuSTMIL) method, allowing to better exploit data paired with global labels and
  to combine contextual and detailed information identified at several magnification
  levels.  The method is based on a multiple instance learning framework and on a
  multi-task network, that combines features from several magnification levels and
  produces multiple predictions (a global one and one for each magnification level
  involved).  MuSTMIL is evaluated on colon cancer images, on binary and multilabel
  classification.  MuSTMIL shows an improvement in performance in comparison to both
  single scale and another multi-scale multiple instance learning algorithm, demonstrating
  that MuSTMIL can help to better deal with global labels targeting full and multi-scale
  images.
