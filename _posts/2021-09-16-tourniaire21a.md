title: "Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning with\r Mixed Supervision on the
  Camelyon16 Dataset"
abstract: "Since the standardization of Whole Slide Images\r (WSIs) digitization,
  the use of deep learning\r methods for the analysis of histological images has\r
  shown much potential. However, the sheer size of\r WSIs is a real challenge, as
  they are often up to\r 100,000 pixels wide and high at the highest\r resolution,
  and therefore cannot be processed\r directly by any model. Moreover, as the manual\r
  delineation of structures within WSIs is tedious,\r histological datasets often
  only contain slide-level\r labels, or a limited amount of delineated slides. In\r
  this context, multiple-instance learning (MIL)\r approaches have been proposed,
  considering WSIs as\r bags of smaller images, designated as tiles or\r patches.
  Among these methods, the attention-based\r MIL aims at learning the importance of
  each tile for\r the slide final classification while at the same\r time performing
  a clustering of those tiles. In this\r paper, we introduce the concept of mixed
  supervision\r within this framework, by exploiting tile-level\r labels in addition
  to slide-level labels to improve\r the classification of slides. More precisely,
  we\r show on the Camelyon16 dataset that even a small\r proportion of slides with
  pixel-wise annotations can\r improve their classification but also the\r localization
  of tumorous regions. This improves the\r consistency of the results between the
  tile and\r slide levels and the interpretability of the\r algorithm."
