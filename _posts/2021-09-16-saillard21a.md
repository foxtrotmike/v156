title: Self-supervised learning improves dMMR/MSI detection from histology slides
  across multiple cancers
abstract: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a tumor phenotype whose diagnosis largely
  impacts patient care in colorectal cancers (CRC), and is associated with response
  to immunotherapy in all solid tumors. Deep learning models detecting MSI tumors
  directly from H&E stained slides have shown promise in improving diagnosis of MSI
  patients. Prior deep learning models for MSI detection have relied on neural networks
  pretrained on ImageNet dataset, which does not contain any medical image. In this
  study, we leverage recent advances in self-supervised learning by training neural
  networks on histology images from the TCGA dataset using MoCo V2. We show that these
  networks consistently outperform their counterparts pretrained using ImageNet and
  obtain state-of-the-art results for MSI detection with AUCs of 0.92 and 0.83 for
  CRC and gastric tumors, respectively. These models generalize well on an external
  CRC cohort (0.97 AUC on PAIP) and improve transfer from one organ to another. Finally
  we show that predictive image regions exhibit meaningful histological patterns,
  and that the use of MoCo features highlighted more relevant patterns according to
  an expert pathologist.
