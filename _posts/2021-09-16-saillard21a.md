title: "Self-supervised learning improves dMMR/MSI detection\r from histology slides
  across multiple cancers"
abstract: "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a tumor\r phenotype whose diagnosis
  largely impacts patient\r care in colorectal cancers (CRC), and is associated\r
  with response to immunotherapy in all solid\r tumors. Deep learning models detecting
  MSI tumors\r directly from H&E stained slides have shown promise\r in improving
  diagnosis of MSI patients. Prior deep\r learning models for MSI detection have relied
  on\r neural networks pretrained on ImageNet dataset,\r which does not contain any
  medical image. In this\r study, we leverage recent advances in\r self-supervised
  learning by training neural networks\r on histology images from the TCGA dataset
  using MoCo\r V2. We show that these networks consistently\r outperform their counterparts
  pretrained using\r ImageNet and obtain state-of-the-art results for MSI\r detection
  with AUCs of 0.92 and 0.83 for CRC and\r gastric tumors, respectively. These models\r
  generalize well on an external CRC cohort (0.97 AUC\r on PAIP) and improve transfer
  from one organ to\r another. Finally we show that predictive image\r regions exhibit
  meaningful histological patterns,\r and that the use of MoCo features highlighted
  more\r relevant patterns according to an expert\r pathologist."
