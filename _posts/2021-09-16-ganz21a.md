title: Automatic and explainable grading of meningiomas from histopathology images
abstract: Meningioma is one of the most prevalent brain tumors in adults. To determine
  its malignancy, it is graded by a pathologist into three grades according to WHO
  standards. This grade plays a decisive role in treatment, and yet may be subject
  to inter-rater discordance. In this work, we present and compare three approaches
  towards fully automatic meningioma grading from histology whole slide images. All
  approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where we first identify a region
  of interest based on the detection of mitotic figures in the slide using a state-of-the-art
  object detection deep learning network. This region of highest mitotic rate is considered
  characteristic for biological tumor behavior. In the second stage, we calculate
  a score corresponding to tumor malignancy based on information contained in this
  region using three different settings. In a first approach, image patches are sampled
  from this region and regression is based on morphological features encoded by a
  ResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a logistic regression from the
  determined mitotic count, an approach which is easily traceable and explainable.
  Lastly, we combine both approaches in a single network. We trained the pipeline
  on 951 slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a separate set of 141 slides
  from 43 patients. All approaches yield a high correlation to the WHO grade. The
  logistic regression and the combined approach had the best results in our experiments,
  yielding correct predictions in $32$ and $33$ of all cases, respectively, with the
  image-based approach only predicting $25$ cases correctly. Spearman’s correlation
  was $0.7163$, $0.7926$ and $0.7900$ respectively. It might be counter-intuitive
  at first that morphological features provided by the image patches do not improve
  model performance. Yet, this mirrors the criteria of the grading scheme, where mitotic
  count is the only unequivocal parameter.
