title: "Automatic and explainable grading of meningiomas\r from histopathology images"
abstract: "Meningioma is one of the most prevalent brain tumors\r in adults. To determine
  its malignancy, it is graded\r by a pathologist into three grades according to WHO\r
  standards. This grade plays a decisive role in\r treatment, and yet may be subject
  to inter-rater\r discordance. In this work, we present and compare\r three approaches
  towards fully automatic meningioma\r grading from histology whole slide images.
  All\r approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where\r we first identify a
  region of interest based on the\r detection of mitotic figures in the slide using
  a\r state-of-the-art object detection deep learning\r network. This region of highest
  mitotic rate is\r considered characteristic for biological tumor\r behavior. In
  the second stage, we calculate a score\r corresponding to tumor malignancy based
  on\r information contained in this region using three\r different settings. In a
  first approach, image\r patches are sampled from this region and regression\r is
  based on morphological features encoded by a\r ResNet-based network. We compare
  this to learning a\r logistic regression from the determined mitotic\r count, an
  approach which is easily traceable and\r explainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches
  in a\r single network. We trained the pipeline on 951\r slides from 341 patients
  and evaluated them on a\r separate set of 141 slides from 43 patients. All\r approaches
  yield a high correlation to the WHO\r grade. The logistic regression and the combined\r
  approach had the best results in our experiments,\r yielding correct predictions
  in $32$ and $33$ of all\r cases, respectively, with the image-based approach\r only
  predicting $25$ cases correctly. Spearman’s\r correlation was $0.7163$, $0.7926$
  and $0.7900$\r respectively. It might be counter-intuitive at first\r that morphological
  features provided by the image\r patches do not improve model performance. Yet,
  this\r mirrors the criteria of the grading scheme, where\r mitotic count is the
  only unequivocal parameter."
