title: "An Automatic Nuclei Image Segmentation Based on\r Multi-Scale Split-Attention
  U-Net"
abstract: "Nuclei segmentation is an important step in the task\r of medical image
  analysis. Nowadays, deep learning\r techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks\r
  (CNNs) have become prevalent methods in nuclei\r segmentation. In this paper, we
  propose a network\r called Multi-scale Split-Attention U-Net (MSAU-Net)\r for further
  improving the performance of cell\r segmentation. MSAU-Net is based on U-Net\r architecture
  and the original blocks used to\r down-sampling and up-sampling paths are replaced\r
  with Multi-scale Split-Attention blocks for\r capturing independent semantic information
  of nuclei\r images. A public microscopy image dataset from 2018\r Data Science Bowl
  grand challenge is selected to\r train and evaluate MSAU-Net. By running trained\r
  models on the test set, our model reaches average\r Intersection over Union (IoU)
  of 0.851, which is\r better than other prominent models, especially 4.8\r percent
  higher than the original U-Net. For other\r evaluation metrics including accuracy,
  precision,\r recall and F1-score, MSAU-Net shows better\r performance in the most
  of indicators. The\r outstanding result reveals that our proposed model\r presents
  a promising nuclei segmentation method for\r the microscopy image analysis."
