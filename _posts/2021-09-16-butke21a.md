title: End-to-end Multiple Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Cytopathology of Urothelial
  Carcinoma
abstract: As a non-invasive approach, cytopathology of urine sediment is a highly
  promising approach to diagnosing urothelial carcinoma. However, computational assessment
  of the cytopathological status of a sample raises the challenge of identifying few
  cancerous cells among thousands of cells in a microscopic whole-slide image. To
  address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end trainable multiple instance learning
  approach that combines the attention mechanism and hard negative mining to classify
  hematoxylin and eosin stained patient-level whole-slide images of urine sediment
  cells. The singular cells are extracted by a simple foreground detection algorithm.
  With feature embeddings computed for each image patch in a bag by a convolutional
  neural network, the attention mechanism serves as the pooling operator, enabling
  a bag-level prediction while still giving an interpretable score for each image
  patch. This enables the identification of key instances and potential regions of
  interest that trigger a patient-level decision. Our results show that the proposed
  system can differentiate between normal and cancerous urothelial cells, thus enabling
  the non-invasive diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma in patients using urine sediment
  analysis.
