title: "End-to-end Multiple Instance Learning for\r Whole-Slide Cytopathology of Urothelial
  Carcinoma"
abstract: "As a non-invasive approach, cytopathology of urine\r sediment is a highly
  promising approach to\r diagnosing urothelial carcinoma. However,\r computational
  assessment of the cytopathological\r status of a sample raises the challenge of\r
  identifying few cancerous cells among thousands of\r cells in a microscopic whole-slide
  image. To address\r this challenge, we propose an end-to-end trainable\r multiple
  instance learning approach that combines\r the attention mechanism and hard negative
  mining to\r classify hematoxylin and eosin stained patient-level\r whole-slide images
  of urine sediment cells. The\r singular cells are extracted by a simple foreground\r
  detection algorithm. With feature embeddings\r computed for each image patch in
  a bag by a\r convolutional neural network, the attention\r mechanism serves as the
  pooling operator, enabling a\r bag-level prediction while still giving an\r interpretable
  score for each image patch. This\r enables the identification of key instances and\r
  potential regions of interest that trigger a\r patient-level decision. Our results
  show that the\r proposed system can differentiate between normal and\r cancerous
  urothelial cells, thus enabling the\r non-invasive diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma
  in\r patients using urine sediment analysis."
