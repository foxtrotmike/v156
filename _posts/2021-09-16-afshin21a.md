title: "Multi-scale Regional Attention Deeplab3+: Multiple\r Myeloma Plasma Cells
  Segmentation in Microscopic\r Images"
abstract: "Multiple myeloma cancer is a type of blood cancer\r that happens when the
  growth of abnormal plasma\r cells becomes out of control in the bone\r marrow. There
  are various ways to diagnose multiple\r myeloma in bone marrow, such as a complete
  blood\r count test (CBC) or counting myeloma plasma cells in\r aspirate slide images
  using manual visualization or\r image processing techniques. In this work, an\r
  automatic deep learning method for detecting and\r segmentation multiple myeloma
  plasma cells has been\r explored. To this end, a two- stage deep learning\r method
  is designed. In the first stage, the nucleus\r detection network is utilized to
  extract each\r instance of a cell of interest. The extracted\r instance is then
  fed to the multi-scale function to\r generate a multi-scale representation. The
  objective\r of the multi-scale function is to capture the shape\r variation and
  reduce the effect of object scale on\r the cytoplasm segmentation network. The generated\r
  scales are then fed into a pyramid of cytoplasm\r networks to learn the segmentation
  map in various\r scales. On top of the cytoplasm segmentation\r network, we included
  a scale aggregation function to\r refine and generate a final prediction. The proposed\r
  approach has been evaluated on the SegPC2021 grand\r challenge and ranked second
  on the final test phase\r among all teams."
