title: Symmetric Dense Inception Network for Simultaneous Cell Detection and Classification
  in Multiplex Immunohistochemistry Images
abstract: Deep-learning based automatic analysis of the multiplex immunohistochemistry
  (mIHC) enables distinct cell populations to be localized on a large scale, providing
  insights into disease biology and therapeutic targets. However, standard deep-learning
  pipelines performed cell detection and classification as two-stage tasks, which
  is computationally inefficient and faces challenges to incorporate neighbouring
  tissue context for determining the cell identity. To overcome these limitations
  and to obtain a more accurate mapping of cell phenotypes, we presented a symmetric
  dense inception neural network for detecting and classifying cells in mIHC slides
  simultaneously. The model was applied with a novel stop-gradient strategy and a
  loss function accounted for class imbalance. When evaluated on an ovarian cancer
  dataset containing 6 cell types, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.835 in cell
  detection, and a weighted F1-score of 0.867 in cell classification, which outperformed
  separate models trained on individual tasks by 1.9% and 3.8% respectively. Taken
  together, the proposed method boosts the learning efficiency and prediction accuracy
  of cell detection and classification by simultaneously learning from both tasks.
