title: "Symmetric Dense Inception Network for Simultaneous\r Cell Detection and Classification
  in Multiplex\r Immunohistochemistry Images"
abstract: "Deep-learning based automatic analysis of the\r multiplex immunohistochemistry
  (mIHC) enables\r distinct cell populations to be localized on a large\r scale, providing
  insights into disease biology and\r therapeutic targets. However, standard deep-learning\r
  pipelines performed cell detection and\r classification as two-stage tasks, which
  is\r computationally inefficient and faces challenges to\r incorporate neighbouring
  tissue context for\r determining the cell identity. To overcome these\r limitations
  and to obtain a more accurate mapping of\r cell phenotypes, we presented a symmetric
  dense\r inception neural network for detecting and\r classifying cells in mIHC slides
  simultaneously. The\r model was applied with a novel stop-gradient\r strategy and
  a loss function accounted for class\r imbalance. When evaluated on an ovarian cancer\r
  dataset containing 6 cell types, the model achieved\r an F1 score of 0.835 in cell
  detection, and a\r weighted F1-score of 0.867 in cell classification,\r which outperformed
  separate models trained on\r individual tasks by 1.9% and 3.8%\r respectively. Taken
  together, the proposed method\r boosts the learning efficiency and prediction\r
  accuracy of cell detection and classification by\r simultaneously learning from
  both tasks."
