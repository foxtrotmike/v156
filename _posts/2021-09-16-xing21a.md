title: "A Multi-scale Graph Network with Multi-head\r Attention for Histopathology
  Image Diagnosisn"
abstract: " Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining plays an\r essential role in brain glioma
  diagnosis, but\r reading pathologic images and generating diagnostic\r reports can
  be a tedious and laborious\r work. Pathologists need to combine and navigate\r extremely
  large images with different scales and to\r quantify different aspects for subtyping.
  In this\r work, we propose an automatic diagnosis algorithm to\r identify cell types
  and severity of H&E slides, in\r order to classify five major subtypes of glioma
  from\r whole slide pathological images. The proposed method\r is featured by a pyramid
  graph structure and an\r attention-based multi-instance learning strategy. We\r
  claim that our method not only improve the\r classification accuracy by utilizing
  multi-scale\r information, but also help to identify high risk\r patches. We summarized
  patches from multiple\r resolutions into a graph structure. The nodes of the\r pyramid
  graph are feature vectors extracted from\r image patches, and these vectors are
  connected by\r their spatial adjacency. We then fed the graph into\r the proposed
  model with self-attention and graph\r convolutions. Here, we used a multi-head\r
  self-attention architecture, where same\r self-attention blocks are stacked in parallel.
  As\r proven in Transformer networks, multiple attention\r maps herein capture comprehensive
  activation\r patterns from different subspace\r representation. Using the proposed
  method, the\r results show a 70% accuracy for glioma\r subtyping. The multiresolution
  attention maps\r generated from the proposed method could help locate\r proliferations
  and necrosis in the whole pathologic\r slide."
