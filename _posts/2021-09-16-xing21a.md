title: A Multi-scale Graph Network with Multi-head Attention for Histopathology Image
  Diagnosisn
abstract: " Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining plays an essential role in brain glioma
  diagnosis, but reading pathologic images and generating diagnostic reports can be
  a tedious and laborious work. Pathologists need to combine and navigate extremely
  large images with different scales and to quantify different aspects for subtyping.
  In this work, we propose an automatic diagnosis algorithm to identify cell types
  and severity of H&E slides, in order to classify five major subtypes of glioma from
  whole slide pathological images. The proposed method is featured by a pyramid graph
  structure and an attention-based multi-instance learning strategy. We claim that
  our method not only improve the classification accuracy by utilizing multi-scale
  information, but also help to identify high risk patches. We summarized patches
  from multiple resolutions into a graph structure. The nodes of the pyramid graph
  are feature vectors extracted from image patches, and these vectors are connected
  by their spatial adjacency. We then fed the graph into the proposed model with self-attention
  and graph convolutions. Here, we used a multi-head self-attention architecture,
  where same self-attention blocks are stacked in parallel. As proven in Transformer
  networks, multiple attention maps herein capture comprehensive activation patterns
  from different subspace representation. Using the proposed method, the results show
  a 70% accuracy for glioma subtyping. The multiresolution attention maps generated
  from the proposed method could help locate proliferations and necrosis in the whole
  pathologic slide."
