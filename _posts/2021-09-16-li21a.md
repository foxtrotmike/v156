title: "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for the\r Histopathological Cell Segmentation
  through\r Self-Ensembling"
abstract: "Histopathological images are generally considered as\r the golden standard
  for clinical diagnosis and\r cancer grading. Accurate segmentation of\r cells/nuclei
  from histopathological images is a\r critical step to obtain reliable morphological\r
  information for quantitative analysis. However,\r cell/nuclei segmentation relies
  heavily on\r well-annotated datasets, which are extremely\r labor-intensive, time-consuming,
  and expensive in\r practical applications. Meanwhile, one might want to\r fine-tune
  pretrained models on certain target\r datasets. But it is always difficult to collect\r
  enough target training images for proper\r fine-tuning. Therefore, there is a need
  for methods\r that can transfer learned information from one\r domain to another
  without additional target\r annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel\r framework
  for cell segmentation on the unlabeled\r images through the unsupervised domain
  adaptation\r with self-ensembling. It is achieved by applying\r generative adversarial
  networks (GANs) for the\r unsupervised domain adaptation of cell segmentation\r
  crossing different tissues. Images in the source and\r target domain can be differentiated
  through the\r learned discriminator. Meanwhile, we present a\r self-ensembling model
  to consider the source and the\r target domain together as a semi-supervised\r segmentation
  task to reduce the differences of\r outputs. Additionally, we introduce conditional\r
  random field (CRF) as post-processing to preserve\r the local consistency on the
  outputs. We validate\r our framework with unsupervised domain adaptation on\r three
  public cell segmentation datasets captured\r from different types of tissues, which
  achieved\r superior performance in comparison with\r state-of-the-art."
