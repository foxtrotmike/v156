title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for the Histopathological Cell Segmentation
  through Self-Ensembling
abstract: Histopathological images are generally considered as the golden standard
  for clinical diagnosis and cancer grading. Accurate segmentation of cells/nuclei
  from histopathological images is a critical step to obtain reliable morphological
  information for quantitative analysis. However, cell/nuclei segmentation relies
  heavily on well-annotated datasets, which are extremely labor-intensive, time-consuming,
  and expensive in practical applications. Meanwhile, one might want to fine-tune
  pretrained models on certain target datasets. But it is always difficult to collect
  enough target training images for proper fine-tuning. Therefore, there is a need
  for methods that can transfer learned information from one domain to another without
  additional target annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for cell
  segmentation on the unlabeled images through the unsupervised domain adaptation
  with self-ensembling. It is achieved by applying generative adversarial networks
  (GANs) for the unsupervised domain adaptation of cell segmentation crossing different
  tissues. Images in the source and target domain can be differentiated through the
  learned discriminator. Meanwhile, we present a self-ensembling model to consider
  the source and the target domain together as a semi-supervised segmentation task
  to reduce the differences of outputs. Additionally, we introduce conditional random
  field (CRF) as post-processing to preserve the local consistency on the outputs.
  We validate our framework with unsupervised domain adaptation on three public cell
  segmentation datasets captured from different types of tissues, which achieved superior
  performance in comparison with state-of-the-art.
