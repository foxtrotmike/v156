title: "Creating small but meaningful representations of\r digital pathology images"
abstract: "Representation learning is a popular application of\r deep learning where
  an object (e.g., an image) is\r converted into a lower-dimensional representation\r
  that still encodes relevant features of the original\r object. In digital pathology,
  however, this is more\r difficult because whole slide images (WSIs) are\r tiled
  before processing because they are too large\r to process at once. As a result,
  one WSI can be\r represented by thousands of representations - one\r for each tile.
  Common strategies to aggregate the\r \"tile-level representations\" to a \"slide-level\r
  representation\" rely on pooling operators or even\r attention networks, which all
  find some weighted\r average of the tile-level representations.  In this\r work,
  we propose a novel approach to aggregate\r tile-level representations into a single
  slide-level\r representation. Our method is based on clustering\r representations
  from individual tiles that originate\r from a large pool of WSIs. Each cluster can
  be seen\r as encoding a specific feature that might occur in a\r tile. Then, the
  final slide-level representation is\r a function of the proportional cluster membership
  of\r all tiles from one WSI. We demonstrate that we can\r represent WSIs in parsimonious
  representations and\r that these aggregated slide-level representations\r allow
  for both WSI classification and, reversely,\r similar image search. "
