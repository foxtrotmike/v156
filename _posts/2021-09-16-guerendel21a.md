title: Creating small but meaningful representations of digital pathology images
abstract: 'Representation learning is a popular application of deep learning where
  an object (e.g., an image) is converted into a lower-dimensional representation
  that still encodes relevant features of the original object. In digital pathology,
  however, this is more difficult because whole slide images (WSIs) are tiled before
  processing because they are too large to process at once. As a result, one WSI can
  be represented by thousands of representations - one for each tile. Common strategies
  to aggregate the "tile-level representations" to a "slide-level representation"
  rely on pooling operators or even attention networks, which all find some weighted
  average of the tile-level representations.  In this work, we propose a novel approach
  to aggregate tile-level representations into a single slide-level representation.
  Our method is based on clustering representations from individual tiles that originate
  from a large pool of WSIs. Each cluster can be seen as encoding a specific feature
  that might occur in a tile. Then, the final slide-level representation is a function
  of the proportional cluster membership of all tiles from one WSI. We demonstrate
  that we can represent WSIs in parsimonious representations and that these aggregated
  slide-level representations allow for both WSI classification and, reversely, similar
  image search. '
