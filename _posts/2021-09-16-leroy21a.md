title: "Magnetic Resonance Imaging Virtual Histopathology\r from Weakly Paired Data"
abstract: "The pathological analysis of biopsy specimens is\r essential to cancer
  diagnosis, treatment selection\r and prognosis. However, biopsies are only taken
  from\r part of the tumor and cannot assess the full\r cellular extension. Such information
  is essential to\r delineate as accurately as possible the tumor volume\r on a three-dimensional
  basis. Furthermore, they\r require highly qualified personnel and are\r associated
  with significant risks. The aim of our\r work is to provide alternative means to
  gather\r clinical information related to histology through MR\r image translation
  towards virtual pathological\r content generation. Conventional approaches to\r
  address this objective exploit paired data that is\r cumbersome to achieve due to
  tissue collapse and\r deformation, different resolution scales and absence\r of
  plane correspondences. In this paper, we\r introduce a versatile, scalable and robust\r
  closed-loop dual synthesis concept that composes two\r generation mechanisms - cycle-consistent
  generative\r adversarial networks -, one exploring weakly paired\r data and a subsequent
  harnessing virtually generated\r paired correspondences. The clinical relevance
  and\r interest of our framework are demonstrated in\r prostate cancer patients.
  Qualitative clinical\r assessment and quantitative reconstruction\r measurements
  demonstrate the potential of our\r approach."
