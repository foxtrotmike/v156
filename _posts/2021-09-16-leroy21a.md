title: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Virtual Histopathology from Weakly Paired Data
abstract: The pathological analysis of biopsy specimens is essential to cancer diagnosis,
  treatment selection and prognosis. However, biopsies are only taken from part of
  the tumor and cannot assess the full cellular extension. Such information is essential
  to delineate as accurately as possible the tumor volume on a three-dimensional basis.
  Furthermore, they require highly qualified personnel and are associated with significant
  risks. The aim of our work is to provide alternative means to gather clinical information
  related to histology through MR image translation towards virtual pathological content
  generation. Conventional approaches to address this objective exploit paired data
  that is cumbersome to achieve due to tissue collapse and deformation, different
  resolution scales and absence of plane correspondences. In this paper, we introduce
  a versatile, scalable and robust closed-loop dual synthesis concept that composes
  two generation mechanisms - cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks -,
  one exploring weakly paired data and a subsequent harnessing virtually generated
  paired correspondences. The clinical relevance and interest of our framework are
  demonstrated in prostate cancer patients. Qualitative clinical assessment and quantitative
  reconstruction measurements demonstrate the potential of our approach.
