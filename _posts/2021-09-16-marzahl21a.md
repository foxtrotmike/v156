title: "Robust Quad-Tree based Registration on Whole Slide\r Images"
abstract: "The registration of whole slide images (WSIs)\r provides the basis for
  many subsequent processing\r steps in digital pathology. For instance, the\r registration
  of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and\r hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)-stained WSIs is usually\r
  the first step in guiding IHC diagnostic\r procedures. Still, many registration
  methods operate\r poorly on WSIs. Reasons for this include the WSI\r size, fluctuating
  image quality or elastic tissue\r deformations. Multiple prior methods are further\r
  specialised towards a specific image modality, such\r as histology or cytology,
  or rely on a specific\r preparation protocol. To minimise these effects, we\r developed
  a robust WSI registration, which differs\r from previous methods by the following
  new aspect:\r We introduce a multi-scale approach based on a\r quad-tree (QT), with
  several termination criteria\r that makes the algorithm particularly insensitive
  to\r tissue artefacts and that further allows to estimate\r a piece-wise affine
  transformation. We validated our\r method on five scanner systems and 60 WSIs with\r
  different stainings. Our results outperformed any\r publicly available WSI registration
  method. The QT\r code, WSI landmarks and tools used to create the\r validation dataset
  are made publicly available. "
