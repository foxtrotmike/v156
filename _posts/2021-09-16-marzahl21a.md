title: Robust Quad-Tree based Registration on Whole Slide Images
abstract: 'The registration of whole slide images (WSIs) provides the basis for many
  subsequent processing steps in digital pathology. For instance, the registration
  of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)-stained WSIs is usually
  the first step in guiding IHC diagnostic procedures. Still, many registration methods
  operate poorly on WSIs. Reasons for this include the WSI size, fluctuating image
  quality or elastic tissue deformations. Multiple prior methods are further specialised
  towards a specific image modality, such as histology or cytology, or rely on a specific
  preparation protocol. To minimise these effects, we developed a robust WSI registration,
  which differs from previous methods by the following new aspect: We introduce a
  multi-scale approach based on a quad-tree (QT), with several termination criteria
  that makes the algorithm particularly insensitive to tissue artefacts and that further
  allows to estimate a piece-wise affine transformation. We validated our method on
  five scanner systems and 60 WSIs with different stainings. Our results outperformed
  any publicly available WSI registration method. The QT code, WSI landmarks and tools
  used to create the validation dataset are made publicly available. '
